## Description
The game of tic-tac-toe is a game that can be perfected. Meaning a player can only win, when their opponet makes a mistake.

In this case, the player will be going against a computer program. Because the program doesn't make mistakes, it is impossible to beat it. In theory, the program makes a move 
by assigning a value to the game after analyzing all possible outcomes.
Although it is impossible to win against the program, it is possible to never lose against it. 

If the program was to play against itself, every game would end in a draw.
